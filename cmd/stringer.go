Copyright 2014 The Go Authors. All rights reserved.

Stringer is a tool to automate the creation of methods that satisfy the fmt.Stringer
interface. Given the name of a (signed or unsigned) integer type T that has constants
defined, stringer will create a new self-contained Go source file implementing
	func (t T) String() string
The file is created in the same package and directory as the package that defines T.
It has helpful defaults designed for use with go generate.

For more information, see:

	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		stringer.RunCommand(cmd, args)
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(stringerCmd)

	stringer.Flags(stringerCmd.Flags())

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// stringerCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// stringerCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
